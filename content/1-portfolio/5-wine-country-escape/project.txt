This stunning property featuring a custom wine display with a spectacular backlit, onyx wall, is majestically situated at the outer ridge of a winding country road in the mountains above Sonoma. Sited on 18 acres of rich vineyard soil, this ultra-modern home was completely redesigned by Favreau Design.

Paying tribute to the surrounding landscape while infusing the home with a chic contemporary vibe was our chief concern. Furnishings were to be unique and powerful yet neutral so as to allow the views to star. The client wanted to highlight the home’s contemporary style yet infuse warm finishes and an eclectic mix of furniture, art, sculpture and two hand-blown glass chandeliers, made specifically for the home in Czechoslovakia, evoking the pop and fizz of champagne’s bubbles adding a sophisticated drama and playfulness to the homes main living area high above wine country.
