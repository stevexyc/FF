Text: Favreau Design loves antique factory buildings. This two-story loft is part of a group of luxury condominiums created out of an old clock tower building in San Francisco. Favreau Design designed a second story bedroom suite overlooking the 2,800 square foot homeâ€™s main living area using antique joists combined with mortis and tenant construction applications. Extensive demolition exposed its beautiful brick patina and industrial finishes give this unique property the idea rustic chic the client wanted.
