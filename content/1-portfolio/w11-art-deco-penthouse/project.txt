Text: San Francisco is known for its distinctive architecture and dramatic cityscape. The clients for this art deco inspired building in San Francisco’s Buena Vista Park neighborhood wanted an elegant home with a liberal mix of contemporary, deco inspired and vintage/antique pieces.

Favreau Design created a color palate of moody grays, crisp whites, and creamy gold as a canvas to the client’s sparkling jewel toned decanter collection highlighted by silver and gold leaves. Paramount to the project was a complete bath and kitchen remodel.

The living room boasts one of those wonderful San Francisco views out across a sea of urbanity to the bay and Berkeley beyond. As is often the case, this client wanted the view to be the star and for the homes décor to be serene – the calm in a whirlwind of energy that is San Francisco.
